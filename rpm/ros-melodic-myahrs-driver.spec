%description
myahrs_driver is a driver package for the WITHROBOT's myAHRS+. The myAHRS+ is a
low cost high performance AHRS(Attitude Heading Reference System) with
USB/UART/I2C interface. The myAHRS+ board contains a 3-axis 16-bit gyroscope, a
3-axis 16-bit accelerometer and a 3-axis 13-bit magnetometer. The driver should
also work with USB port.
